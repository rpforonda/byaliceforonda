        <span class="block">I live in Baden-Württemberg, Germany with my husband and three children.</span>
        <span class="block">
          I love to write stories inspired by my own experiences and imagination.

          When I'm not writing, I study German and play volleyball.
        </span>
        <span class="block">
          My debut children's book, Crosby's Cosmic Adventure, was inspired by my own struggle with belonging and self-acceptance.
          I hope you are able to see yourself and connect with the stories and characters I write about.
